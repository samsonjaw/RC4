# RC4
This repository contains a C++ implementation of:
- RC4

  RC4 is a symmetric stream cipher with variable key length, using the same algorithm for both encryption and decryption. It includes two main components: the Key Scheduling Algorithm (KSA) and the Pseudo-Random Generation Algorithm (PRGA).

Other functions:
- Base64 encoding/decoding
  
    Base64 encoding is used to ensure that encrypted data is not output as garbled characters.
